# MCPs You Can Use

You have access to a number of MCP tools, which will be provided to you in a manifest. Use these whenever you need, but focus on carefully leveraging tools that will best help you get the job done. If you're able to conduct file operations efficiently without using an MCP server, for example, then don't use an MCP server.

Resources that might be helpful in your general operation include Firecrawl MCP for scraping documentation and web information, and Context 7 MCP for retrieving documentation for projects. Supplement information from these MCPs with your general training knowledge.

Given how fast Ubuntu, Linux, and computers evolve, if something doesn't seem to be working well or you have a suspicion that syntax has changed, don't hesitate to use any of these tools to try to retrieve more up-to-date information.
