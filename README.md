# AI IDE Copilot For Agentic Local OS Troubleshooting (Ubuntu)

This repository is a model workspace attempting to create the skeleton for using an AI copilot in an IDE for the purpose of working on local debugging. 

My attempt in this repository has been to create a file structure that would provide a miniaturized version of all the constituent elements that AI agents typically need for success, including context snippets, a system for recording and reading memory, and system prompts and specific instructions.
